**\*Required**
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I Ensured my HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
I Confirmed that my project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
I Created a working GET API route in my server.
I Created a working POST API route in my client.
I Seeded my database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

Strech Requirment:

I Provided additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

YES
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I was not able to provide animations and other stretch requirements. I knew how to put delete buttons in each of the mesages posted by guests but did not know how to target the elements that it would be deleting. I havent grasped the animation principles too. I believe the like post option is in the same cathegory as the the mentioned observation.

Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission. None

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)? I ony revised my week work and checked for of codes like the one to refresh a page and also to reset a form element from W3School....

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them? None

What went really well and what could have gone better? The fact that I was able to finish the basic job on time is something am happy about. The only issue is that i could not utilise the remaining time to complete my stretch goals because of lack of expertise. I believe this will be improved over time.
